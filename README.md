# MNIST-DIGIT-CLASSIFIER
Here I made a MNIST digit  classifier in which I imported the MNIST dataset and  performed all the techniques of machine learning and showed how One Versus One and One Versus All techniques are used for multiclass classification. Then I trained a neural network on the MNIST dataset and obtained accuray of 98.12%
